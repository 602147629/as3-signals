Signals: Think Outside the Event.\r\n\r\n*Signals* are light-weight, strongly-typed AS3 messaging tools.\r\nWire your application with better APIs and less boilerplate than AS3 Events.\r\n\r\nh2. Concept\r\n\r\n * A *Signal* is essentially a mini-dispatcher specific to one event, with its own array of listeners.\r\n * A Signal gives an event a concrete membership in a class. \r\n * Listeners subscribe to real objects, not to string-based channels.\r\n * Event string constants are no longer needed.\r\n * Signals are inspired by \"C# events\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_syntax#Events and  \"signals/slots\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_and_slots in Qt. \r\n\r\nh2.
